# DualNet: Robust Self-Supervised Stereo Matching with Pseudo-Label Supervision [AAAI 2025 (Oral)](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/32882/35037)
Existing self-supervised stereo matching methods heavily rely on the **photo-metric consistency assumption**, which is vulnerable to natural disturbances, resulting in ambiguous supervision and inferior performance compared to the supervised ones. To relax the limitation of the photo-metric consistency assumption and even bypass this assumption, we propose a novel self-supervised framework named **DualNet**, which consists of two key steps: robust selfsupervised teacher learning and pseudo-label supervised student training. Specifcally, the teacher model is frst trained in a self-supervised manner with a focus on feature-metric consistency and data augmentation consistency. Then, the output of the teacher model is geometrically constrained to obtain high-quality pseudo labels. Benefting from these highquality pseudo labels, the student model can outperform its teacher model by a large margin. With the two well-designed steps, the proposed framework DualNet ranks **1st** among all self-supervised methods on multiple benchmarks, surprisingly even outperforming several supervised counterparts.
